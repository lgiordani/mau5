# The TextBuffer is an object used to interact with a text file.
#
# The object contains by default an empty piece of text and no
# initial context, but it can accept both at initialisation time.
#
# The object itself doesnt interact with files, the text content
# has to be loaded externally. The `text` parameter is a single
# string containing newlines, the object will split it internally.
# When a piece of text is loaded it is split into lines using `\n`.
#
# The attribute `initial_context` allows to nest pieces of text that
# come from different sources. The property `context` takes the
# initial context into account and adjusts the line and column.
#
# The object has several properties:
# * `eof` - True if the current line is beyond the last line.
# * `eol` - True if the current column is beyond the last column
#   of the current line.
# * `current_line` - The current line of the file or an empty string
#   in case of EOF.
# * `current_char` - The current character of the current line
#   or an empty string in case of EOL/EOF.
# * `peek_char` - The next character of the current line
#   or an empty string in case of EOL/EOF.
# * `tail` - The remaining part of the line starting with the next
#   character.
# * `position` - (getter/setter) A tuple (line, column) with the
#   current position.
# * `context` - A instance of Context relative to `initial_context`.
#
# The class also exposes three main methods:
# * `load` - Loads a string into the internal buffer. The string is
#   split using newlines `\n`.
# * `nextline` - Moves to the beginning of the next line.
# * `skip` - Skips the given number of characters.
#
# The class has been designed to minimise the number of exceptions it
# can raise, so it will quietly go beyond the end of the line of beyond
# the end of the file. It's the users task to check whether one of
# these conditions occured.
